# 📌 Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

This repository showcases a collection of projects implementing various **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Transformer** techniques — organized by learning type and the frameworks used (TensorFlow, PyTorch, spaCy, Rasa, etc.).

Each project includes:

* 📓 **Jupyter Notebooks** with step-by-step training workflows.
* ⚙️ **Python scripts (.py)** for model interaction.
* 🌐 **Streamlit web apps** to test models in an interactive environment.
* 📂 **Trained and pre-trained models** ready for deployment.
